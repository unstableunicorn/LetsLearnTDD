# Lets Learn TDD
This is a small demo repo to check out and follow allong with the instructions below

## What is TDD?
TDD stands for Test Driven Development.

## The TDD process and why the steps are important
* Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure
* Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software
* Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with

## Dicipline
1. Write a test
1. Make the compiler pass
1. Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
1. Write enough code to make the test pass
1. Refactor

## Refactoring
When refactoring code you must not be changing behaviour

## What are we going to do?
We are going to create a test for a simple hello world end point that should return the users name.

## Next steps
1. Test setup and tear down
1. Dependancy Injection
